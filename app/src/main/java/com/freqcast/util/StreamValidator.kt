/**
 * Probes a stream URL before it's saved, so a typo'd or dead URL is caught immediately instead
 * of surfacing as "Connection failed" the first time the user tries to play it.
 *
 * Tries HEAD first (cheap, no body); many Icecast/Shoutcast mounts reject HEAD with 405 or just
 * hang up, so this falls back to GET and closes the response as soon as headers arrive without
 * reading the (effectively infinite) stream body.
