 * Persists the state the home screen widget (Glance, see `widget/RadioWidget`) needs to render:
 * which station is showing and whether it's currently playing. Separate from [PlaybackStateStore]
 * because that store's contract is "last STARTED station, cleared on explicit stop" (so it can
 * resume playback after a process death) — the widget instead wants to keep showing the last
 * station with a play affordance even after the user explicitly stops, rather than going blank.
