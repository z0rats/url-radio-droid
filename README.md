# 📻 Freqcast — Internet Radio Player

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/z0rats/freqcast/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/z0rats/freqcast)

A modern open-source Android internet radio player that finds streams from station websites.

I built Freqcast because I couldn't find a radio app that stayed simple. Most alternatives either include ads, depend on proprietary station catalogs, or make adding custom stations harder than it should be.

Freqcast is fully local, requires no account, and works with standard HTTP/HTTPS streams and HLS. The goal is simple: if a station has a public stream, you should be able to listen to it without fighting the app.

### ✨ What makes it different?

Most radio apps expect you to manually find the actual stream URL.

Freqcast lets you paste the station's website instead. It first checks Radio Browser, then scans the website itself, discovers a playable stream, verifies that it works, and adds it to your library. In many cases, you never have to hunt for a .mp3, .aac, or .m3u8 URL yourself.

- ⏪ Timeshift for compatible streams
- 🎶 Live ICY metadata
- 😴 Sleep timer and multiple wake-up alarms
- 🏠 Home screen widget and Android Auto

## Why Freqcast?

Internet radio is one of those technologies that has quietly survived for decades, but the Android ecosystem around it has become surprisingly fragmented.

I wanted a player that simply plays internet radio well, stores everything locally, supports modern Android APIs, and makes adding stations effortless—even when all you have is the station's homepage.

Freqcast started as that personal project and gradually evolved into a fully featured open-source player.
