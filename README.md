## ✨ Features

- 📍 Add radio stations with name and stream URL
- **🖼️ Custom station icons**: pick an emoji or upload your own image for any station, shown in the list and mini player; Discover-added stations auto-fetch the station's real logo when the directory has one
- **🔎 Discover stations**: search the [Radio Browser](https://api.radio-browser.info/) public directory by name, genre, country, or language and add results straight to your library, no need to hunt down stream URLs yourself; results show country flag, codec/bitrate, vote count, and a homepage link, and flag stations whose HTTPS certificate failed validation
- **📍 "Near me" search**: find stations near you using your device's coarse location — sent only for that one search, never stored, with an in-app explanation before the system permission prompt
- 📜 View list of saved stations with search (when more than 4 stations)
- **✋ Drag to reorder**: long-press a station and drag it up or down to arrange your list exactly how you want
- **🏷️ Genres/tags**: stations added via Discover pick up the directory's tags automatically; manually-added stations can have one too; search matches it alongside name and URL
- **📱 App Shortcuts**: long-press the launcher icon for one-tap play of your last-played station and the first one in your list, no need to open the app first
- **⚙️ Settings screen**: export/import your stations and toggle a metered-connection playback warning
- **🌐 Localization**: available in English, Russian, Spanish, and Simplified Chinese
- ▶️ Play streams using ExoPlayer
- 🔇 Background playback support with media notifications
- **🎯 Unified player and list state**: the bottom mini player and the active list item always show the same station and play/pause state
- **🎵 Mini player**: always visible when a station is selected; play/pause; tap to open full playback screen
- **👆 Swipe to switch stations**: swipe left/right on the mini player to switch to previous/next station in the list; smooth slide animation
- **📊 Playback status**: Playing, Paused, Starting… (also when buffering), or Connection failed (after ~10 s if stream does not start, or immediately on invalid URL)
- **📡 HLS support**: `.m3u8` URLs are played via ExoPlayer’s HLS support (manifest + segments); no timeshift for HLS
- **⏪ Timeshift (rewind)**: for single-URL streams, rewind 5 seconds or jump back to live; live indicator shows when you are at the live edge
- **⚠️ Connection error handling**: invalid or unreachable stream URL shows "Connection failed" toast; app does not crash
- **🔁 Reliable background playback**: automatically resumes the last station if the system kills and restarts the app process; reconnects on network loss with capped exponential backoff (up to 5 attempts) instead of hammering the stream or retrying forever
- **🎶 Live track title**: shows the current track (from ICY/Shoutcast metadata, when the stream provides it) in the mini player and playback screen, with a one-tap copy-to-clipboard button
- **😴 Sleep timer**: stop playback automatically after 15/30/45/60 minutes, with a live countdown shown on the playback screen
- **⏰ Wake-up alarms**: set multiple daily alarms (each with its own time + station) from the overflow menu; each fires via the system alarm clock even if the app isn't running, and reschedules itself for the next day automatically
- **🏠 Home screen widget**: play/pause, station name, and next/prev buttons right from the home screen, no need to open the app
- **🚗 Android Auto**: your station list shows up as a browsable/playable list on the car head unit; tap a station to start it playing
- 💾 Local data storage using Room Database, with unique name/URL constraints enforced at the DB level and safe migrations (no data loss on upgrade)
- **📤 Export / share / import stations**: back up all your stations to a JSON file or share it to another app, share a single station straight from its list item, and import a backup (e.g. after reinstalling or switching devices)
- 🎨 Modern UI with Jetpack Compose (liquid glass style)
- 🌐 Network availability check before playback
- ✔️ URL validation when adding stations, plus a live reachability check (HEAD/GET probe) before saving so a dead stream is caught immediately instead of failing the first time you hit play

## 📋 Requirements

- Android 10 (API 29) or higher
- Android Studio or compatible IDE
- Gradle 9.0+
- Java 24 (for compilation)

## 🔨 Building

1. Clone the repository or open the project in Android Studio
2. Sync Gradle dependencies
3. Build the project: `./gradlew build`
4. Install on device: `./gradlew installDebug`

## 📦 Releases

Installable APKs are published in the repo’s [Releases](releases) section when you push a version tag.

To publish a new release:

1. Create a version tag (e.g. `v1.0`):  
   `git tag v1.0`
2. Push the tag:  
   `git push origin v1.0`
3. On GitHub, open **Actions** — the **Release** workflow will run, build the APK, and create a release with the attached file `freqcast-1.0.apk`.

Release APKs are built as a proper release build (R8 minification + resource shrinking enabled) and signed with a dedicated release keystore. The keystore itself isn't checked into the repo — it's stored base64-encoded in the `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` GitHub Secret, decoded by the `Release` workflow at build time, alongside `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`, and `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Tap the "Add" button (FAB) to add a station manually, or tap the **Discover** chip at the top of the list to search the Radio Browser directory by name/genre/country and add results directly
3. When adding manually, enter station name and stream URL (e.g. `http://stream.example.com:8000/stream` or `https://example.com/stream.m3u8` for HLS)
4. Tap "Save" — the URL is checked for reachability before it's stored
5. Tap a station in the list to play (or tap Play on a station card)
6. Use the bottom mini player: tap for full playback screen; use Play/Pause; swipe left/right to switch to previous/next station
7. **Timeshift** (single-URL streams only): while playing, use the rewind (↺ 5) button to go back 5 seconds; use the Live (●) button to return to the live edge; the Live indicator is bright when at live, dim when in the past
8. **Sleep timer**: on the playback screen, tap the sleep timer chip and pick a duration; tap again to see the countdown or cancel it
9. Playback continues in background with media notification, and resumes automatically if the system needs to kill the app process

## ⏪ Timeshift (rewind)

While a stream is playing, the app records it to a temporary buffer file (default cap ~30 MB). Playback reads from this file, so you can rewind within the buffered range:

- **Rewind 5 s**: jumps back 5 seconds (by reopening the source at the corresponding byte offset; ExoPlayer does not reliably honour `seekTo(ms)` for live-style progressive sources).
- **Live**: jumps to the current end of the buffer (live edge). The Live indicator (●) is bright when at live, dim when in the past.

Buffer file is created in app cache and removed when playback stops. **Timeshift is not used for HLS** (`.m3u8`): those streams are played directly; rewind/Live buttons are hidden.

## 📤 Export / Share / Import Stations

Overflow menu (⋮) on the main screen:

- **Export stations**: sends a JSON backup of *all* your stations (name, stream URL, custom icon) via the system share sheet — pick Telegram, WhatsApp, email, "Save to Files", etc.
- **Import stations**: reads a previously exported/shared JSON backup, or an OPML/M3U/M3U8/PLS playlist file from another app, and adds any stations that aren't already in your list (stations with a name or URL that already exists are skipped, not overwritten). The format is detected automatically from the file's content.

Swipe left on a single station in the list to reveal **Edit / Share / Delete** — Share sends just that one station as its own JSON file (named after the station), so you can quickly send one station to a friend without exporting your whole list. Delete is immediate (no confirmation dialog), but a Snackbar with an **Undo** action lets you restore the station if you tap it by mistake.

This is a convenient way to back up your list before reinstalling the app, move it to another device, or send stations to yourself/a friend.

## 🗄️ Database Migrations

Station names and stream URLs are unique at the database level (not just checked in the UI), and schema changes ship as real Room `Migration`s rather than wiping the database — installed schema versions are checked into [`app/schemas/`](app/schemas/) so every upgrade path can be tested. If you change the `RadioStation` entity or `AppDatabase`, bump the version and add a corresponding `Migration` (see `AppDatabase.MIGRATION_2_3` for a dedupe-then-constrain migration, or `MIGRATION_3_4` for a simple added-column migration) — don't rely on destructive fallback except for very old installs with no schema snapshot to migrate from.

## 🛠 Technologies

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes unit tests for:

- **RadioStation** - data model equality and properties
- **RadioStationDao** - CRUD and ordering (manual `sortOrder`, in-memory database), unique constraint violations
- **AppDatabaseMigrationTest** - migration 2→3 preserves data, dedupes pre-existing collisions, enforces new unique constraints; migration 7→8 replaces `isFavorite` with `sortOrder` derived from the old favorites-first order
- **RadioStationRepositoryBackupTest** - JSON export/import (with old-backup fallback), duplicate skipping, round-trip fidelity
- **StationBackupJson** - single-station and bulk JSON serialization shape
- **MainViewModel** - current playing station, search, delete, drag-to-reorder
- **UrlValidator** - URL validation (AddStationActivity)
- **StreamRecorder** / **TimeshiftController** / **StreamValidator** / **RadioBrowserApi** - recording, buffering, seek state, reachability probing, directory search parsing (via a local `MockWebServer`)
- **StationShare** - share-sheet intent (`ACTION_SEND`), file name sanitization, backup file contents
- **RadioPlaybackServiceLogicTest** - HLS detection, retry backoff, retryable-error classification
- **DiscoverStationsViewModel** - debounced search, duplicate/name-collision handling on add
- **AppShortcuts** - dynamic shortcut set for last-played/first-in-list station, dedup when they're the same station
- **AlarmRepository** - alarm CRUD, one-time legacy SharedPreferences->Room import (and its idempotency)
- **AlarmScheduler** - next-trigger-time math (today vs. tomorrow, including the exactly-now edge case), per-alarm-id scheduling not clobbering other alarms
- **AlarmStateStore** - save/restore round-trip, including a saved-but-disabled alarm, and `clear()`
- **AlarmReceiver** - starts playback for the alarm identified by id, no-ops when disabled/unknown/unset, falls back to migrating a still-pending legacy alarm when no id is present
- **BootReceiver** - reschedules every enabled alarm after a reboot, including a still-pending legacy alarm
- **AlarmListViewModel** / **AlarmEditViewModel** - list load/enable/delete, form load/save/delete, legacy alarm migration event

Screenshot (pixel-diff) tests use [Roborazzi](https://github.com/takahirom/roborazzi) over Robolectric's native-graphics mode, catching visual regressions (clipped shadows, invisible text) that a plain unit test can't. Reference images live in `app/src/test/screenshots/` and are committed to the repo.

### Running Tests Locally

- **Lint**: Checks Kotlin code style with ktlint
- **Build**: Builds the debug APK

View workflow status in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

## 🔐 Permissions

The application requests the following permissions:

- `INTERNET` - for stream playback
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` - for network availability check
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` + `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` - for background playback
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - for media notifications (Android 13+)
- `WAKE_LOCK` - keeps the network alive while playing with the screen off (background listening is the app's whole point)
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - reschedules every enabled wake-up alarm after a reboot (AlarmManager alarms are cleared on reboot)
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` - needed for wake-up alarms to fire at the exact time you set; on some devices you may need to grant "Alarms & reminders" access from Settings (the app will prompt you if so)
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` - only requested when you use Discover's "Near me" search; your location is sent for that one search and never stored
